Hi there! I'm Reeha, a UK-based aspiring full-stack software developer. I recently embarked on my journey into the world of coding by joining the School of Code in February 2024. Since then, I've been passionately developing my skills across various aspects of software development.

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll gain insight into some of the personal projects I've been working on over the past few weeks. But wait, there's more! This portfolio website itself is one of my personal projects, and I'm thrilled to share that over the next few weeks, I'll be developing it to be fully functional.

In my journey as a developer, I've dived deep into frontend development, crafting engaging user interfaces with technologies like React and Next.js. On the backend, I've been honing my skills in building robust and scalable APIs, using frameworks such as Express.js and databases like PostgreSQL. Additionally, I'm committed to ensuring the quality and reliability of my applications through rigorous testing and quality assurance practices.

I have big plans for this website, including utilizing DevOps practices, implementing DNS management, deploying with Next.js and React, and much more. Stay tuned as I bring my vision to life and showcase my journey in software development!
